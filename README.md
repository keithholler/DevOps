# DevOps

Used the following

NodeJs,
Express,
MongoDb,
Mongoose

I used the above to build the CRUD application. Express gives a very easy framework to work with. While Mongoose adds on to MongoDB
for added support woth Schemas. I use the Async and Await to get rid of callbacks. I used nodemon in dev so after every update 
the server would restart.

As long as you have mongodb installed on you computer and your Envirenment Variable Path updated to the mongodb Bin folder you
will be able to run the application from any computer all IP address have been whtelisted.


You can use Postman to test the routes:<br />
Get <br />
Get by ID<br />
Post<br />
Put by Id<br />
Delete by Id

To start<br />
Pull or Download the branch<br />
In you terminal run "npm install" to install dependencies<br />
npm run start.<br />
Running on http://localhost:3000/ingredients

Thank you Enjoy!
